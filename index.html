    <p>MMD 1.SEM F2023 Hold A<br><br>
      Hi I am Soma Paul who came from Bangladesh. I went to Danish language school and completed high school in denmark. This country has given me an education, a language and lovely friends.<br>
I chose to study MMD in Denmark because I enjoy working with graphics, and I believe that this subject offers many career opportunities.I had little experienc with HTML, but programming with CSS, grids, JS, animations was completely new.<br>
In the first semester of my studies, I was introduced to so much knowledge that I can now design and set up a website all by myself. Although there are still many things I have to learn, there are some things that I could include in the CV. And I can say without a doubt that during the course I understood that I like the design and programming process. It's something I could see myself working with in the future.
