               <p><strong>Animation</strong></p><br> 
               <p>  In Theme 4, we have learned to make interactive animated games that we have designed and programmed ourselves. To get started with idea development, we have created several exercises such as a cross-list exercise and 10 ideas. I got the idea for my game right away. It was supposed to be about cat and mouse. I have created an activity diagram, which helps to structure the actions in the game, where you can see which action leads to the next.</p><br>

  <p><strong>CSS-animation og JavaScript </strong></p><br> 
  <p>After we finished the design part, we started making css animations. We have learned that you must first create a class with animation, which is assigned to the element to be animated, and then create @keyframes, where you can change the element (add a movement, scale the element). We did a series of exercises which helped to understand the concept and afterwards we were able to implement that knowledge in our game.We were introduced to JavaScript, which is responsible for the site's functionality. JavaScript tells the page what to do. There we can control how different elements will be displayed on the page. In our game, we could, for example, use JS to control the start and end screens, the elements that fall or pop up, the animation on those elements, etc.</p><br>
