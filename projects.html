     <p>02.01.02 WEBSITE<br>

        At the start of the education, I have learned about different user interfaces and basic methods and front-end technologies in creating websites.<br> I was introduced to html, css and have learned how to set up a website from scratch. I have learned that i have to create the mobile version at the beginning and afterwards, using "media query" to set up grids and compose the elements on the page.<br> In the first task I had to follow the task and set up the page. I learned about wireframe and layout diagrams.<br> I used the same knowledge many times in connection with other subsequent tasks. I was eventually allowed to partially work on the design. I chose the colors on the website, designed the buttons, selected fonts and set up the text.</p>
