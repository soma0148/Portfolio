     <p>02.01.02 WEBSITE<br>

        At the start of the education, I have learned about different user interfaces and basic methods and front-end technologies in creating websites.<br> I was introduced to html, css and have learned how to set up a website from scratch. I have learned that i have to create the mobile version at the beginning and afterwards, using "media query" to set up grids and compose the elements on the page.<br> In the first task I had to follow the task and set up the page. I learned about wireframe and layout diagrams.<br> I used the same knowledge many times in connection with other subsequent tasks. I was eventually allowed to partially work on the design. I chose the colors on the website, designed the buttons, selected fonts and set up the text.</p>

    <p>02.02.01 EMNESITE <br>

        In the topic assignment, I was able to use the knowledge I gained from the first assignment to set up and design my own topic site. In order to start the task, I first had to come up with a topic that I am interested in. There I used the "mind map" method, where I wrote down my thoughts and got different ideas. I have an understanding of Yoga. At that moment I could imagine how I could make the site - the style, the colors, the composition.<br>

        To set up the pages, I made wireframes. For the cover, I have chosen to create an asymmetrical composition, the images partly overlap each other. To implement the idea, I have made a layout diagram, and have made several grids around the divers, because I can make the images responsive. During the task, I had changed it in the code to change the order in the mobile version.</p>

    <p>Moodboard <br>

        I started looking for inspiration online. I was introduced to Adobe Color, where I could find the color palettes that suited my subject. Then I collected my ideas in a mood board. After all the inspiration-seeking process, I have chosen to make the website in a modernist style. The concept is to create a visually light, smooth website with relatively a lot of negative space with small decorative details that do not overload the page. I have chosen warm brownish and beige colors that go with the subject. To have an idea of the site's design, I had made a mockup in Adobe XD.</p>

    <p>Styletile <br>

        In order to make the work on the project easier, we have learned to make style tiles, where you collect all fonts, colors, elements on the page, such as buttons, links, logo, etc. In this way, you can always go back to the elements, if you e.g. forget something. It also gives a good overview of the style, color selection and fonts. There are three different fonts, which in my opinion go well with the subject and the style. Header has some soft, round edges, which could be associated with e.g. cappuccino. The sub-header is more square and coarse, like e.g. espresso. In addition, I work in Adobe Illustrator to create logo, favicon.</p>
