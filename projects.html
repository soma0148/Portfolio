     <p>02.01.02 WEBSITE<br>

        At the start of the education, I have learned about different user interfaces and basic methods and front-end technologies in creating websites.<br> I was introduced to html, css and have learned how to set up a website from scratch. I have learned that i have to create the mobile version at the beginning and afterwards, using "media query" to set up grids and compose the elements on the page.<br> In the first task I had to follow the task and set up the page. I learned about wireframe and layout diagrams.<br> I used the same knowledge many times in connection with other subsequent tasks. I was eventually allowed to partially work on the design. I chose the colors on the website, designed the buttons, selected fonts and set up the text.</p>

    <p>02.02.01 EMNESITE <br>

        In the topic topic assignment, I was able to use the knowledge I gained from the first assignment to set up and design my own topic site. In order to start the task, I first had to come up with a topic that I am interested in. There I used the "mind map" method, where I wrote down my thoughts and got different ideas. I have an understanding of Yoga. At that moment I could imagine how I could make the site - the style, the colors, the composition.

        To set up the pages, I made wireframes. For the cover, I have chosen to create an asymmetrical composition, the images partly overlap each other. To implement the idea, I have made a layout diagram, and have made several grids around the divers, because I can make the images responsive. During the task, I had changed it in the code to change the order in the mobile version.</p>
