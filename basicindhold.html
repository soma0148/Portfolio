<p>In Theme 5, we had to get a basic introduction to video and photo production. In the first part of the theme, we had to record a video interview with an external sound and edit it in Premier Pro and Audition. We also had to create a pilot site, which contains video and pictures and brief information about the interview. In this task we were  3. The person I have to interview is our classmate Ona who is an artist and has her own practice. I  interviewed her and 3rd person took some shots in different image crops, which I then cut into a video. The B role took a book. I opted out of background music because I thought it would distract from the message coming from the interviewer. I edited the video in Premier Pro where I cut it and edited the colors, contrasts and the speed.

        <p>We chosed one beauty saloon and got permission to redesign her website. Everybody got two pages to redesign and we were four persons in our team. I took prices and contact pages. I designed it in this way and submitted to one of them. Though company website has no logo but I made two logos and added one of them.
