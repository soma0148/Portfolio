        <p>PortfolioExam <br>
             <br>
             In the theme 6 assignment, I had to implement all the knowledge I gained during the education and create a portfolio website with all the assignments. To get started with the task, I have thought a little about how it has been for me to study at KEA. I wanted to make a website that would reflect me, my study.</p><br>
             <br>
             <p>To find inspiration for the design, I made a mood board and a number of sketches, wireframes and layout diagrams. Afterwards, I made a style tile where I chose fonts, buttons and hovers. In my assignment pages, I have chosen to create a simple layout with text and a slide show. I have chosen to highlight some of the elements and write a detailed description of them.<br>
               <br>
                To make the slide show, I have used the code from the internet and implemented it on my page, in addition there are 2 slide shows on some of the pages and this causes challenges with JavaScript, which I then solve afterwards. I also made a burger menu on all the pages and the code for it I took from a YouTube tutorial but changed the design to fit the website.<br>
                <br>
                I've also done 5 second tests to see what other people understand about the page. I got good feedback with some ideas that I could work on further, e.g. that on the portfolio page you could make an animation with the paper boat as it comes towards the tasks.</p>
