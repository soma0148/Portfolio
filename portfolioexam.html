              <p>PortfolioExam <br>
             <br>
             In the theme 6 assignment, I had to implement all the knowledge I gained during the education and create a portfolio website with all the assignments. To get started with the task, I have thought a little about how it has been for me to study at KEA. I wanted to make a website that would reflect me and my study.</p><br>
             <br>
             <p>Our teachers always teach us many things and at last recommend us to play with the new methods & technics such as, css, Js, prototype in XD or Adobe. So that we can learn better. That's why I think as a student I should become like a dolphin that is always playful and friendly. So I made an imagine prompt on my Bluewillow where there is playful dolphin with rainbow and water. Our education is like vast ocean where I have to be playful to learn as much as necessary for my course.</p><br>
             <br>
             <p>To make this website I took a online svg of dolphin as my beautiful logo that is suitable for my portfolio website. I used my previous codes and also added new codes to complete my work. I have to learn a lot about JavaScript. Besides these I used resources from Kea's fronter & youtube. Finally I can see that I went far away from my first plan because I changed it several times due to many errors but it looks good now.</p><br>
